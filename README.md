# AUTOMATIC-SHOOTING-GUN-USING-IMAGE-PRCOESSING
IN THIS RESPOSITORY  I GIVEN THE CODE FOR AUTOMATIC SHOOTING GUN, WHICH AUTOMATICALLY DETECTS THE TARGET USING IMAGE PROCESSING AND THEN THE GUN SHOOTS
THE DETAILED PROCESSING IS THAT I HAVE WRITTEN A CODE IN PYTHON TO DETECT THE TARGET AND THEN ACCORDINGLY MOVE THE GUN AND ONCE THE GUN GETS ALLIGNED WITH THE TARGET IT SHOOTS.
IT HAS PLENTLY OF APPLICATIONS IN DEFENCE, LIKE IN MY COUNTRY LOT OF TERRORISTS ARE CROSSING THE BORDER AND ARE LEFT UNDETECTED SO SUCH GUNS CAN BE DEPLOYED FOR THESE TERRORRISTS
